# Homebrews

Homebrews is a personal project of mine that aims to satiate the need for a simple to use brewing web app with no gimmicks or limitations. 

Currently, you are able to construct a recipe and optionally create a "Brewday" session from the recipe.

I am currently working on the UX for the site. The next features I am implementing is forking recipes of other users and creating a visual pipeline of currently fermenting beers. 

Feel free to give it a shot at any point, just beware that it's still very much in development, and there's issues. If you happen to stumble upon my humble project, and find something wrong, please feel entitled to leave an issue on the repository. 

Thanks!
Ron

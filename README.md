# Homebrews

Homebrews is a personal project of mine that aims to satiate the need for a simple to use brewing web app with no gimicks or limitations. 

Currently, there's not much to it. You can build a recipe and calculate relevant values. I'm working on implementing a "Brewday" session based off a recipe currently, and hop to have that complete soon.

After that, I would like to implement the ability to fork public recipes into your own recipe cache. 

Feel free to give it a shot at any point, just beware that it's still very much in development, and there's issues. If you happen to stumble upon my humble project, and find something wrong, please feel entitled to leave an issue on the repository. 

Thanks!
Ron
